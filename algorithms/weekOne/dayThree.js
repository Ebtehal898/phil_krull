// Reverse Array
// -----------------------------------------------------
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of the
// values. The reversed array should have the same
// length, with existing elements moved to other
// indices so that the order of elements is reversed.

// Remove Negatives
// -----------------------------------------------------
// Implement a function removeNegatives() that
// accepts an array and removes any values that
// are less than zero.
// Second-level challenge: donâ€™t use nested loops.

// Skyline Heights
// -----------------------------------------------------
// You are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings in the city. For example, [-1,7,3] would
// represent three buildings: first is actually below street level, second is seven stories high, and third is
// three stories high (but hidden behind the seven-story onbe). You are situated at street level. Return an
// array containing heights of the buildings you can see, in order. Given [1,-1,7,3] return [1,7].
